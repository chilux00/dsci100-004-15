    "After importing the dataset from the provided link, we observed that the columns lacked descriptive names, making it challenging to interpret and analyze the data effectively. In response, we took a step in our data wrangling and cleaning process by assigning meaningful names to each column based on the information available on the source website, using the `setNames` function.\n",

However, this organization could introduce bias when splitting the data for training and testing purposes.\n",

By doing so, we ensure that our subsequent data split into training and testing sets will be representative and unbiased, with a balanced representation of all three types of iris flowers. This comprehensive approach to data preparation, including renaming columns and randomizing rows, sets the foundation for a more reliable and robust analysis in our exploration of the Iris dataset.\n",

    "After conducting a visual exploration of the relationships between petal and sepal measurements in our dataset, we created scatterplots to compare petal_width vs. sepal_width and petal_length vs. sepal_length. These visualizations revealed compelling patterns where points from the same iris type tended to cluster together in different regions of the plots. This suggested a potential relationship between petal and sepal measurements and the type of iris flower.\n",

One model will focus on utilizing petal length and width as features, while the other model will use sepal length and width.
