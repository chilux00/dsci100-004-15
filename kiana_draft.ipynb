    "In this data analysis project, having 3 categories to be potentially used for the prediction of a patient's stroke status, we aim to find the best knn model between them. with the 3 categories being demographics, health, and lifestyle, we predict that the health category involving hypertension, heart disease and stress level predictors will have the highest accuracy to be used as a prediction model to find out a patient's stroke history status.

Knowing the most impactful factors, healthcare professionals can determine if someone is at a higher risk of having a stroke by putting more focus on those factors. Depending on the outcome of our study, people can improve their lifestyle habits and take preventive measures to reduce their risks of getting a stroke."
